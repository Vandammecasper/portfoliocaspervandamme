This is the reason why I wanted to learn how to code. So in 2021 I began my journey in mct at the Howest in Kortrijk, Belgium. After 3 semesters we had to choose between several sub-directions. Over these 3 semesters and several projects I found out that my preference lies in design and front-end development. So I chose for the sub-direction 'Next web developer'. I am currently still in mct and I keep learning more and more every day.</h2>
